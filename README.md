## Reminders in Status Bar

Just what it says -- shows your Reminders in the mac's status bar. I know
they show in the side bar and in the dock and what not, but I still tend to
look to the status bar for stuff.

Mostly though, this is for me to learn a little about writing objective-c and
cocoa mac apps. So, expect lots of bad practices and weird code in here until
I get better.
